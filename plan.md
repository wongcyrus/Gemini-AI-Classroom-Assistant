# Application Enhancement Plan

This document outlines potential enhancements for the AI Invigilator application.

### 1. **Enhanced AI Analysis & Feedback**

*   **Automated Feedback Loop:** Allow students to reply to AI messages, creating an interactive learning environment where the AI can provide more targeted assistance based on student responses.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Implement sentiment analysis on student's on-screen text to proactively detect frustration or struggle and offer help.
*   **Performance Metrics:** Use the AI to gather detailed performance metrics, such as time spent per question and resource usage, to generate more insightful progress reports for teachers.

### 2. **Improved User Experience**

*   **Real-time Collaboration:** Implement a co-browsing or screen-sharing feature with annotations to allow teachers to guide students in real-time without taking control of their computer. *Note: Direct remote control is not feasible from a web app and has significant security implications.*
*   **Customizable Dashboards:** Allow teachers and students to customize their dashboards by choosing which widgets and notifications to display.
*   **Mobile App:** Develop a mobile application for teachers to monitor students and receive notifications on the go.

### 3. **Enhanced Security & Administration**

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement a more granular RBAC system with roles like "super-admin" and "teaching-assistant" for better control over user permissions.
*   **Audit Logs:** Introduce a comprehensive audit logging system to track all user activity for security and compliance purposes.
*   **LMS Integration:** Integrate with popular Learning Management Systems like Moodle or Canvas for seamless data exchange and easier class management.

### 4. **Code & Performance Optimizations**

*   **Code Refactoring:** Refactor larger components in the `web-app` into smaller, reusable ones to improve readability and maintainability.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Optimize Firestore queries and implement a "lazy loading" strategy for resources like screenshots to improve application performance.
*   **Testing:** Add a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
